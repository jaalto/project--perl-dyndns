NAME
    dyndns.pl - Update IP address to dynamic DNS (DDNS) provider

SYNOPSIS
        dyndns.pl --login LOGIN --password PASSWORD \
                  --Host yourhost.dyndns.org

    Note: By Default this program expects www.dyndns.org provider. If you
    use other provider, see option --Provider

OPTIONS
  Gneneral options
    --Config=FILE [--Config=FILE ...]
        List of configuration files to read. No command line options other
        than --verbose, --debug or --test should be appended or results are
        undefined. Each file must contain complete DDNS account
        configuration.

        The FILE part wll go through Perl's "glob()" function, meaning that
        the filenames are expanded if standard shell wild card is supplied.
        Series of configuration files can be run at once e.g. within
        directory "/etc/dyndns/" by using a single option. The order of the
        files processed is alphabetical:

            --Config=/etc/dyndns/*

        See section CONFIGURATION FILE for more information how to write the
        files.

    --Host=host1 [--Host=host2 ...]
        Use registered HOST(s).

    --group GROUP
        This option is only for --Provider noip

        Assign IP to GROUP. Do you have many hosts that all update to the
        same IP address? Update a group instead of a many hosts.

    --login LOGIN
        DDNS account's LOGIN name.

    --mxhost MX-HOST-NAME
        This option is only for --Provider dyndns

        Update account information with MX hostname. Specifies a Mail
        eXchanger for use with the host being modified. Must resolve to an
        static IP address, or it will be ignored. If you don't know DNS,
        don't touch this option.

        The servers you list need to be correctly configured to accept mail
        for your hostname, or this will do no good. Setting up a server as
        an MX without permission of the administrator may get them angry at
        you. If someone is contacted about such an infraction, your MX
        record will be removed and possibly further action taken to prevent
        it from happening again. Any mail sent to a misconfigured server
        listed as an MX may bounce, and may be lost.

    --Mx-option
        This option is only for --Provider dyndns

        Turn on MX option. Request that the MX in the previous parameter be
        set up as a backup. This means that mail will first attempt to
        deliver to your host directly, and will be delivered to the MX
        listed as a backup.

        Note regarding provider "noip":

        Update clients cannot change this value. Clients can only submit
        requests to the php script to update the A record. Changes such as
        MX records must be done through website.

    --Offline
        If given, set the host to offline mode.

        "Note:" [dyndns] This feature is only available to donators. The
        "!donator" return message will appear if this is set on a
        non-donator host.

        This is useful if you will be going offline for an extended period
        of time. If someone else gets your old IP your users will not go to
        your old IP address.

    --password PASSWORD
        DDNS account's PASSWORD.

    --system {dyndns|statdns|custom}
        This option is only for --Provider dyndns

        The system you wish to use for this update. "dyndns" will update a
        dynamic host, "custom" will update a MyDynDNS Custom DNS host and
        "statdns" will update a static host. The default value is "dyndns"
        and you cannot use other options (statdns|custom) unless you donate
        and gain access to the more advanced features.

    --Wildcard
        Turn on wildcard option. The wildcard aliases
        "*.yourhost.ourdomain.ext" to the same address as
        "yourhost.ourdomain.ext"

  Additional options
    --Daemon [WAIT-MINUTES]
        Enter daemon mode. The term "daemon" refers to a standalone
        processes which keep serving until killed. In daemon mode program
        enters into infinite loop where IP address changes are checked
        periodically. For each new ip address check, program waits for
        WAIT-MINUTES. Messages in this mode are reported using syslog(3).

        This option is designed to be used in systems that do not provide
        Unix-like cron capabilities (e.g under Windows OS). It is better to
        use cron(8) and define an entry using crontab(5) notation to run the
        update in periodic intervals. This will use less memory when Perl is
        not permanently kept in memory like it would with option --Daemon.

        The update to DDNS provider happens only if

            1) IP address changes
            2) or it has taken 30 days since last update.
               (See DDNS providers' account expiration time documentation)

        The minumum sleep time is 5 minutes. Program will not allow faster
        wake up times(*). The value can be expressed in formats:

            15      Plain number, minutes
            15m     (m)inutes. Same sa above
            1h      (h)ours
            1d      (d)days

        This options is primarily for cable and DSL users. If you have a
        dial-up connection, it is better to arrange the IP update at the
        same time as when the connection is started. In Linux this would
        happen during ifup(1).

        (*) Perl language is CPU intensive so any faster check would put
        considerable strain on system resources. Normally a value of 30 or
        60 minutes will work fine in most of the ADSL lines. Monitor the
        ISP's IP rotation time to adjust the time in to use sufficiently
        long wake up times.

    --ethernet [CARD]
        In Linux system, the automatic IP detection uses program
        ifconfig(1). If you have multiple network cards, select the correct
        card with this option. The default device queried is "eth0".

    --file PREFIX
        Prefix where to save IP information. This can be a) a absolute path
        name to a file b) directory where to save or c) directory + prefix
        where to save. Make sure that files in this location do not get
        deleted. If they are deleted and you happen to update SAME ip twice
        within a short period - according to www.dyndns.org FAQ - your
        address may be blocked.

        On Windows platform all filenames must use forward slashs like
        C:/somedir/to/, not C:\somedir\to.

        The PREFIX is only used as a basename for supported DDNS accounts
        (see --Provider). The saved filename is constructed like this:

           PREFIX<ethernet-card>-<update-system>-<host>-<provider>.log
                                  |
                                  See option --system

        A sample filename in Linux could be something like this if PREFIX
        were set to "/var/log/dyndns/":

            /var/log/dyndns/eth0-statdns-my.dyndns.org-dyndns.log

    --file-default|-f
        Use reasonable default for saved IP file PREFIX (see --file). Under
        Windows, %WINDIR% is used. Under Linux the PREFIXes searched are

            /var/log/dyndns/     (if directory exists)
            /var/log/            (system's standard)
            $HOME/tmp or $HOME   if process is not running under root

    --proxy HOST
        Use HOST as outgoing HTTP proxy.

    --Provider TYPE
        By default, program connects to "dyndns.org" to update the dynamic
        IP address. There are many free dynamic DNS providers are reported.
        Supported list of TYPES in alphabetical order:

                        http://www.no-ip.com/

    --Query
        Query current IP address and quit. Note: if you use router, you may
        need --urlping* option, otherwise the IP address returned is your
        subnet's DHCP IP and not the ISP's Internet IP.

        Output of the command is at least two string. The second string is
        "last-ip-info-not-available" if the saved ip file name is not
        specified. In order to program to know where to look for saved IP
        files you need to give some --file* or --Config option. The second
        string can also be "nochange" if current IP address is same as what
        was found from saved file. Examples:

            100.197.1.6 last-ip-info-not-available
            100.197.1.6 100.197.1.7
            100.197.1.6 nochange 18
                                 |
                                 How many days since last saved IP

        Note for tool developers: additional information may be provided in
        future. Don't rely on the count of the output words, but instead
        parse output from left to right.

    --Query-ipchanged ['exitcode']
        Print message if IP has changed or not. This option can take an
        optional string argument "exitcode" which causes program to indicate
        changed ip address with standard shell status code (in bash shell
        that would available at variable $?):

            $ dyndns.pl --Query-ipchange exitcode --file-default \
              --Provider dyndns --Host xxx.dyndns.org
            $ echo $?

            ... the status code of shell ($?) would be:

            0   true value, changed
            1   false value, error code, i.e. not changed

        Without the "exitcode" argument, the returned strings are:

                        Current IP address
                        |
            changed  35 111.222.333.444
            nochange 18
                     |
                     Days since last IP update. Based on saved IP file's
                     time stamp.

        If the last saved IP file's time stamp is too old, then even if the
        IP were not really changed, the situation is reported with word
        "changed". This is due to time limits the DDNS providers have. The
        account would expire unless it is updated in NN days.

        Note for tool developers: additional information may be provided in
        future. Don't rely on the count of the output words, but instead
        parse output from left to right.

    --Query-ipfile
        Print the name of the IP file and quit.

        Note: In order for this option to work, you must supply all other
        options would be normally pass to update the DDNS account, because
        the Ip filename depends on these options. Alternatively provide
        option --Config FILE from where all relevant information if read.

            --ethernet      [optional, defaults to eth0]
            --Provider      [optional, defaults to dyndns]
            --system        [optional, defaults to dyndns]
            --Host          required.

        Here is an example which supposed that directory "/var/log/dyndns/"
        already exists:

            $ dyndns.pl --file-default --Query-ipfile \
              --Provider dyndns --Host xxx.dyndns.org
            /var/log/dyndns/eth0-dyndns-dyndns-xxx-dyndns.org.log

    --regexp REGEXP
        In host, which has multiple netword cards, the response can include
        multiple IP addresses. The default is to pick always the first
        choice, but that may not be what is wanted. The regexp MUST not
        contain capturing parentheses: if you need one, use non-capturing
        choice (?:). Refer to Perl manual page "perlre" for more information
        about non-cpaturing regular expression parentheses.

        Here is an example from Windows:

            Ethernet adapter {3C317757-AEE8-4DA7-9B68-C67B4D344103}:

                Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
                Autoconfiguration IP Address. . . : 169.254.241.150
                Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0
                Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :

            Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection 3:

                Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : somewhere.net
                IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 193.10.221.45
                Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0
                Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.0.101

        The 193.10.221.45 is the intended dynamic IP address, not the first
        one. To instruct searching from somewhere else in the listing,
        supply a regular expressions that can match a portion in the listing
        after which the IP address appears. In the above case, the regexp
        could be:

            --regexp "Connection 3:"

        In Windows, the words that follow "IP Address" are automatically
        expected, so you should not add them to the regexp.

        In FreeBSD 4.5, you may get following response:

            tun0: flags <UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1492
                inet6 fe80::250:4ff:feef:7998%tun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x7
                inet 62.214.33.49 --> 255.255.255.255 netmask 0xffffffff
                inet 62.214.32.12 --> 255.255.255.255 netmask 0xffffffff
                inet 62.214.35.49 --> 255.255.255.255 netmask 0xffffffff
                inet 62.214.33.163 --> 62.214.32.1 netmask 0xff000000
                Opened by PID 64

        The correct IP address to pick from the listing is the one, which
        does not contain netmask 0xffffffff. The picked address for above is
        therefore 62.214.33.163. The regexp that finds that line is:

            --regexp ".*0xffffffff.*?inet"
                       |            |
                       |            Search minimum match until word "inet"
                       search maximum match

        This will match all the way until the the last line with netmask
        0xffffffff, after which shortest match ".*?" to "inet" is reached to
        read the number following it. The regexp must make sure that the
        next word after its match point is the wanted address.

  Cable, DSL and router options
        If you do not have direct access to world known "real" IP address,
        but to a subnet IP address, then you cannot determine your outside
        world IP address from your machine directly. See picture below:

                                router/subnet                    Internet
                               +-------------+                +-----------+
           Your PC:            |             | maps address   |           |
           connect to ISP -->  | ROUTER      | -------------> |           |
                               | 192.168.... |                | 80.1.1.1  |
           local ip says:      +-------------+                +-----------+
           192.168.xxx.xxx                                    THE REAL IP

        ASDL and cable modem and other connections may not be directly
        connected to Internet, but to a router to allow subnnetting internal
        hosts. This makes several computers to access the Internet while the
        ISP has offered only one visible IP address to you. The router makes
        the mapping of the local subnet IP to the world known IP address,
        provided by the ISP when the connection was established.

        You need some way to find out what is the real IP is. The simplest
        way is to connect to a some web page, which runs a reverse lookup
        service which can show the connecting IP address.

        Note: the following web web page does not exists. To find a service
        that is able to display your IP address, do a google search. Let's
        say, that you found a fictional service
        "http://www.example.com/showip" and somewhere in the web page it
        reads:

                Your IP address is: 212.111.11.10

        This is what you need. To automate the lookup from web page, you
        need to instruct the program to connect to URL page and tell how to
        read the ip from page by using a regular expression. Consult Perl's
        manual page "perlre" if you are unfamiliar with the regular
        expressions. For the above fictional service, the options needed
        would be:

            --urlping         "http://showip.org/?showit.pl"
            --urlping-regexp  "address is:\s+([\d.]+)"
                                          |  ||
                                          |  |+- Read all digits and periods
                                          |  |
                                          |  +- capturing parentheses
                                          |
                                          +- expect any number of whitespaces

        NOTE: The text to match from web page is not text/plain, but
        text/html, so you must look at the HTML page's sources to match the
        IP address correctly without the bold <b> tags etc.

        --urlping URL

        Web page where world known IP address can be read. If you find a Web
        server that is running some program, which can show your IP addres,
        use it. The example below connects to site and calls CGI program to
        make show the connector's IP address. Be polite. Making calls like
        this too often may cause putting blocks to your site.

            http://www.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/check_ip.cgi

        Be sure to use period of 60 minutes or more with --Daemon option to
        not increase the load in the "ping" site and cause admin's to shut
        down the service.

        --urlping-dyndns

        Contact to www.dyndns.org service to obtain IP address information.
        This is shorthand to more general optiopn --urlping.

        --urlping-linksys [TYPE]

        Specialized router option for Linksys products.

        This option connects to Linksys Wireless LAN 4-point router, whose
        page is by default at local network address
        -<http://192.168.1.1/Status.htm>. The world known IP address (which
        is provided by ISP) is parsed from that page. The product is
        typically connected to the cable or DSL modem. Refer to routing
        picture presented previously.

        If the default login and password has been changed, options
        --urlping-login and --urlping-password must be supplied

        For TYPE information, See <http://www.linksys.com/>. Products codes
        currently supported include:

         - BEFW11S4, Wireless Access Point Router with 4-Port Switch.
           Page: http://192.168.1.1/Status.htm
         - WRT54GL, Wireless WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router.
           Page: http://192.168.1.1/Status_Router.asp

        --urlping-login LOGIN

        If "--urlping" web page requires authentication, supply user name
        for a secured web page.

        --urlping-password LOGIN

        If "--urlping" web page requires authentication, supply password for
        a secured web page.

        --urlping-regexp REGEXP

        After connecting to page with --urlping URL, the web page is
        examined for REGEXP. The regexp must catch the IP to perl match $1.
        Use non-capturing parenthesis to control the match as needed. For
        example this is incorrect:

            --urlping-regexp "(Address|addr:)\s+([0-9.]+)"
                              |                 |
                              $1                $2

        The match MUST be in "$1", so you must use non-capturing perl
        paentheses for the first one:

            --urlping-regexp "(?:Address|addr:) +([0-9.]+)"
                               |                 |
                               non-capturing     $1

        If this option is not given, the default value is to find first word
        that matches:

            ([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)

  Miscellaneous options
    --debug [LEVEL]
        Turn on debug with optional positive LEVEL. Use this if you want to
        know details how the program initiates connection or if you
        experience trouble contacting DDNS provider.

    --help
        Print help

    --Help-html
        Print help in HTML format.

    --Help-man
        Print help page in Unix manual page format. You want to feed this
        output to nroff -man in order to read it.

    --test [LEVEL]
        Run in test mode, do not actually update anything. LEVEL 1 allows
        sending HTTP ping options and getting answers.

    --Test-driver
        This is for developer only. Run internal integrity tests.

    --test-account
        This is for developer only. Uses DYNDNS test account options. All
        command line values that set host information or provider are
        ignored. Refer to client page at http://clients.dyndns.org/devel/

    --verbose
        Print informational messages.

    --Version
        Print version and contact information.

README
    Perl client for updating a dynamic DNS IP information at supported
    providers (see "--Provider"). Visit the page of the provider and create
    an account. Write down the login name, password and host name you
    registered.

    Program has been designed to work under any version of Windows or Linux,
    possibly Mac OS included. It may not work under other Unix variants due
    to different commands and outputs to get network IP assignment
    information. Please see BUGS section how to provide details to add
    support to other operating systems.

    The dynamic DNS service allows mapping a dynamic IP address to a static
    hostname. This way the computer can be refereed by name instead of ever
    changing IP address from ISP's pool. The DDNS providers have may have
    basic services, like single account and single host name, which may
    still be free of charge. Please check the current status form the pages
    of the providers.

    Separate files are used for remembering the last IP address to prevent
    updating the same IP address again. This is necessary in order to comply
    guidelines of the providers where multiple updates of the same IP
    address could cause your domain to be blocked. You should not normally
    need to touch the files where the ip addresses are stored.

    If you know what you are doing and desperately need a forced update,
    delete the IP files and start program with apropriate arguments. Without
    the information about previous IP address, program sends a new update
    request to the provider.

    For windows operating systems, you need to install Perl. There are two
    Perl incarnatons: Native Windows version (Activestate Perl) and Cygwin
    version. It is recommended that you install Cygwin suite, which includes
    Perl from "http://www.cygwin.com/". The Cygwin is a Unix layer running
    on top of windws and makes it possible to use cron jobs etc. just like
    in Linux systems. If you have no prior experience on Unix/Linux, then
    the Activestate Perl might be better for Windows. Activestate includes a
    Windows installer, but the Perl programs must be run through Perl
    interpreter. For Activestate, put programs along PATH and use command
    line call with option -S to instruct to search PATH:

        perl -S dyndns.pl [options]

EXAMPLES
    To check current IP address:

      dyndns.pl --Query [--urlping...]
                        |
                        Select correct option to do the "ping" for IP

    Show where the ip file is/would be stored with given connect options.
    The option --file-default uses OS's default directory structure.

      dyndns.pl --file-default --Query-ipfile --Provider dyndns \
                --Host xxx.dyndns.org

    To upate account information to DDNS provider:

      dyndns.pl --login <login> --password <pass> --Host your.dyndns.org

    If you have a cable or DSL and your router can display a web page
    containing the world known IP address, you can instruct to "ping" it.
    Suppose that router occupies address 192.168.1.1 and page that displays
    the world known IP is "status.html", and you have to log in the router
    using username "foo" and password "bar":

      dyndns.pl --urlping http://192.168.1.1/Status.html \
                --urlping-login foo                      \
                --urlping-pass  bar                      \

    If the default regexp does not find IP address from the page, supply
    your own match with option --urlping-regexp. In case of doubt, add
    option --debug 1 and examine the responses. In serious doubt, contact
    the maintainer (see option --Version) and send the full debug output.

    Tip: if you run a local web server, provider "www.dyndns.org" can direct
    calls to it. See option "--Wildcard" to enable `*.your.dyndns.org'
    domain delegation, like if it we accessed using `www.your.dyndns.org'.

CONFIGURATION FILE
    Instead of supplying options at command line, the options can be stored
    to configuration files. For each DDNS account and different domains, a
    separate configuration file must be created. The configuration files are
    read with option --Config.

    The syntax of the configuration file includes comments that start with
    (#). Anything after hash-sign is interpreted as comment. Values are set
    in KEY = VALUE fashion, where spaces are non-significant. Keys are not
    case sensitive, but values are.

    Below, lines marked with [default] need only be set if the default value
    needs to be changed. Lines marked with [noip] or [dyndns] apply to only
    those providers' DDNS accounts. Notice that some keys, like "host", can
    take multple values seprated by colons. On/Off options take values [1/0]
    respectively. All host name values below are fictional.

        # /etc/dyndns/dyndns.conf

        #  Set to "yes" to make this configuration file excluded
        #  from updates.

        disable  = no       # [default]

        ethernet = eth0     # [default]
        group    = mygourp  # [noip]
        host     = host1.dyndns.org, host1.dyndns.org

        #   If you route mail. See dyndns.org documentation for details
        #   how to set up MX records. If you know nothing about DNS/BIND
        #   Don't even consider using this option. Misuse or broken
        #   DNS at your end will probably terminate your 'free' dyndns contract.

        mxhost   = mxhost.dyndns.org

        #   Details how to get the world known IP address, in case the standard
        #   Linux 'ifconfig' or Windows 'ipconfig' programs cannot be used. This
        #   interests mainly Cable, DSL and router owners. NOTE: You may
        #   not use all these options. E.g. [urlping-linksys4] is alternate
        #   to [urlping] etc. See documentation.

        urlping-linksys  = BEFW11S4
        urlping-login    = joe
        urlping-password = mypass

        urlping          = fictional.showip.org
        urlping-regexp   = (Address|addr:)\s+([0-9.]+)

        #   Where IPs are stored. Directory name or Directory name with
        #   additional file prefix. The directory part must exist. You could
        #   say 'file = /var/log/dyndns/' but that's the default.

        file     = default              # Use OS's default location

        #   The DDNS account details

        login    = mylogin
        password = mypass
        provider = dyndns               # [default]
        proxy    = myproxy.myisp.net    # set only if needed for HTTP calls

        #   Hou need this option only if you have multiple ethernet cards.
        #   After which regexp the IP number appers in ifconfig(1) listing?

        regexp   = .*0xffffffff.*?inet

        #   What account are you using? Select 'dyndns|statdns|custom'

        system   = dyndns               # Provider [dyndns] only

        #   Yes, delegate all *.mydomain.dyndns.org calls

        wildcard = 1

        # End of cnfiguration file

    See the details of all of these options from the corresponding command
    line option descriptions. E.g. option 'ethernet' in configuration file
    corresponds to --ethernet command line option. The normal configuration
    file for average user would only include few lines:

        #   /etc/dyndns/myhost.dyndns.org.conf

        host             = myhost.dyndns.org
        file             = default      # Use OS's default location
        login            = mylogin
        password         = mypassword
        provider         = dyndns
        system           = dyndns       # or 'statdns'
        wildcard         = 1            # Delegate *.mydomain.dyndns.org

        # End of cnfiguration file

    TODO (write Debian daemon scripts) FIXME:

        update-rc.d dyndns start 3 4 5 6    # Debian

SUPPORT REQUESTS
    For new Operating System, provide all relevant commands, their options,
    examples and their output which answer to following questions. The items
    in parentheses are examples from Linux:

        - How is the OS detected? Send result of 'id -a', or if file/dir
          structure can be used to detect the system. In Lunux the
          existence of /boot/vmlinuz could indicate that "this is a Linux
          OS".
        - What is the command to get network information (commandlike 'ifconfig')
        - Where are the system configuration files stored (in directory /etc?)
        - Where are the log files stored (under /var/log?)

    To add support for routers that can be connected through HTTP protocol
    or with some other commands, please provide connection details and full
    HTTP response:

      lynx -dump http://192.168.1.0/your-network/router/page.html

TROUBLESHOOTING
    1. Turn on --debug to see exact details how the program runs and what
    HTTP requests are sent and received.

    2. Most of the <--Query> options can't be used standalone. Please see
    documentation what additional options you need to supply with them.

ENVIRONMENT
    TMPDIR
        Directory of temporary files. Defaults to system temporary dir.

FILES
    Daemon startup file

        /etc/default/dyndns

    In Linux the syslog message files are:

        /etc/syslog.conf         daemon.err daemon.warning
        /var/log/daemon.log

    There is no default location where program would search for
    configuration files. At installation, configuration examples are put in
    directory "/etc/dyndns/examples". It is recommended that the examples
    are modified and copied one directorory up in order to use option
    --Config /etc/dyndns/*.

    If program is run with Windows Activestate Perl, the log file is stored
    to file "C:/syslog.txt".

BUGS
  Cygwin syslog
    There is no syslog daemon in Cygwin. The Cygwin POSIX emulation layer
    takes care about syslog requests. On NT and above systems it logs to the
    Windows's event manager, on Win9x and ME a file is created in the root
    of drive "C:". See message
    <http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2002-10/msg00219.html> for more details.

    You can see the entries in W2K Start => Settings => Administrative Tools
    => Computer Management: [ System Tools / Event Viewer / Application ]

  Debugging errors
    Please use option --debug 2 and save the result. Contact maintainer if
    you find bugs or need new features.
