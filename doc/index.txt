                              What is a Perl DDNS?

   Perl client for updating a dynamic DNS IP information at supported
   providers (e.g. [5]www.dyndns.org, [6]www.no-ip.com). The dynamic DNS
   service allows mapping a dynamic IP address to a static hostname. This
   way the computer can be referred by name instead of ever changing IP
   address from ISP's pool.

   In short, call the program at regular intervals (say every 6 hours):
  dyndns.pl --Provider dyndns --login LOGIN --pass PASSWORD --Host yourhost.dynd
ns.org

                                Platform Support

   Supported OS platforms: Win32 native (Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP/*), Win32
   [7]Cygwin (Unix like), Linux (Redhat, Debian). Other distributions not
   tested. Should work with any [8]FHS compliant Linux distributions as
   well as BSD provided that command ifconfig(1) is available.
