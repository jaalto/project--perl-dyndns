=head1 NAME

dyndns.pl - Update IP address to dynamic DNS (DDNS) provider

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    dyndns.pl --login LOGIN --password PASSWORD \
              --Host yourhost.dyndns.org

Note: By Default this program expects www.dyndns.org provider. If you use
other provider, see option B<--Provider>

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 Gneneral options

=over 4

=item B<--Config=FILE [--Config=FILE ...]>

List of configuration files to read. No command line options other
than B<--verbose>, B<--debug> or B<--test> should be appended or
results are undefined. Each file must contain complete DDNS account
configuration.

The FILE part wll go through Perl's C<glob()> function, meaning that
the filenames are expanded if standard shell wild card is supplied.
Series of configuration files can be run at once e.g. within directory
C</etc/dyndns/> by using a single option. The order of the files processed
is alphabetical:

    --Config=/etc/dyndns/*

See section CONFIGURATION FILE for more information how to write the files.

=item B<--Host=host1 [--Host=host2 ...]>

Use registered HOST(s).

=item B<--group GROUP>

B<This option is only for --Provider noip>

Assign IP to GROUP. Do you have many hosts that all update to the same
IP address? Update a group instead of a many hosts.

=item B<--login LOGIN>

DDNS account's LOGIN name.

=item B<--mxhost MX-HOST-NAME>

B<This option is only for --Provider dyndns>

Update account information with MX hostname. Specifies a Mail eXchanger for
use with the host being modified. Must resolve to an B<static> IP address,
or it will be ignored. If you don't know DNS, don't touch this option.

The servers you list need to be correctly configured to accept mail for
your hostname, or this will do no good. Setting up a server as an MX
without permission of the administrator may get them angry at you. If
someone is contacted about such an infraction, your MX record will be
removed and possibly further action taken to prevent it from happening
again. Any mail sent to a misconfigured server listed as an MX may bounce,
and may be lost.

=item B<--Mx-option>

B<This option is only for --Provider dyndns>

Turn on MX option. Request that the MX in the previous parameter be set up
as a backup. This means that mail will first attempt to deliver to your
host directly, and will be delivered to the MX listed as a backup.

Note regarding provider C<noip>:

Update clients cannot change this value. Clients can only submit requests
to the php script to update the A record. Changes such as MX records
must be done through website.

=item B<--Offline>

If given, set the host to offline mode.

C<Note:> [dyndns] This feature is only available to donators. The
"!donator" return message will appear if this is set on a non-donator
host.

This is useful if you will be going offline for an extended period of
time. If someone else gets your old IP your users will not go to your
old IP address.

=item B<--password PASSWORD>

DDNS account's PASSWORD.

=item B<--system {dyndns|statdns|custom}>

B<This option is only for --Provider dyndns>

The system you wish to use for this update. C<dyndns> will update a dynamic
host, C<custom> will update a MyDynDNS Custom DNS host and C<statdns> will
update a static host. The default value is C<dyndns> and you cannot use
other options (statdns|custom) unless you donate and gain access to the
more advanced features.

=item B<--Wildcard>

Turn on wildcard option. The wildcard aliases C<*.yourhost.ourdomain.ext>
to the same address as C<yourhost.ourdomain.ext>

=back

=head2 Additional options

=over 4

=item B<--Daemon [WAIT-MINUTES]>

Enter daemon mode. The term "daemon" refers to a standalone processes
which keep serving until killed. In daemon mode program enters
into infinite loop where IP address changes are checked periodically.
For each new ip address check, program waits for WAIT-MINUTES.
Messages in this mode are reported using syslog(3).

This option is designed to be used in systems that do not provide Unix-like
cron capabilities (e.g under Windows OS). It is better to use cron(8) and
define an entry using crontab(5) notation to run the update in periodic
intervals. This will use less memory when Perl is not permanently kept in
memory like it would with option B<--Daemon>.

The update to DDNS provider happens only if

    1) IP address changes
    2) or it has taken 30 days since last update.
       (See DDNS providers' account expiration time documentation)

The minumum sleep time is 5 minutes. Program will not allow faster
wake up times(*). The value can be expressed in formats:

    15      Plain number, minutes
    15m     (m)inutes. Same sa above
    1h      (h)ours
    1d      (d)days

This options is primarily for cable and DSL users. If you have a
dial-up connection, it is better to arrange the IP update at the same
time as when the connection is started. In Linux this would happen
during C<ifup(1)>.

(*) Perl language is CPU intensive so any faster check would put
considerable strain on system resources. Normally a value of 30 or 60
minutes will work fine in most of the ADSL lines. Monitor the ISP's IP
rotation time to adjust the time in to use sufficiently long wake up
times.

=item B<--ethernet [CARD]>

In Linux system, the automatic IP detection uses program
C<ifconfig(1)>. If you have multiple network cards, select the correct
card with this option. The default device queried is C<eth0>.

=item B<--file PREFIX>

Prefix where to save IP information. This can be a) a absolute path name to
a file b) directory where to save or c) directory + prefix where to save.
Make sure that files in this location do not get deleted. If they are
deleted and you happen to update SAME ip twice within a short period -
according to www.dyndns.org FAQ - your address may be blocked.

On Windows platform all filenames must use forward slashs like
C:/somedir/to/, not C:\somedir\to.

The PREFIX is only used as a basename for supported DDNS accounts (see
B<--Provider>). The saved filename is constructed like this:

   PREFIX<ethernet-card>-<update-system>-<host>-<provider>.log
                          |
                          See option --system

A sample filename in Linux could be something like this if PREFIX were set
to C</var/log/dyndns/>:

    /var/log/dyndns/eth0-statdns-my.dyndns.org-dyndns.log

=item B<--file-default|-f>

Use reasonable default for saved IP file PREFIX (see B<--file>). Under
Windows, %WINDIR% is used. Under Linux the PREFIXes searched are

    /var/log/dyndns/     (if directory exists)
    /var/log/            (system's standard)
    $HOME/tmp or $HOME   if process is not running under root

=item B<--proxy HOST>

Use HOST as outgoing HTTP proxy.

=item B<--Provider TYPE>

By default, program connects to C<dyndns.org> to update the dynamic IP
address. There are many free dynamic DNS providers are reported.
Supported list of TYPES in alphabetical order:

    hnorg       No domain name limists
                Basic DDNS service is free (as of 2003-10-02)
                http://hn.org/

    dyndns      No domain name limits.
                Basic DDNS service is free (as of 2003-10-02)
                http://www.dyndns.org/
                See also http://members.dyndns.org/

    noip        No domain name limits.
                Basic DDNS service is free (as of 2003-10-02)
                http://www.no-ip.com/

=item B<--Query>

Query current IP address and quit. B<Note:> if you use router, you may
need --urlping* option, otherwise the IP address returned is your subnet's
DHCP IP and not the ISP's Internet IP.

Output of the command is at least two string. The second string is
C<last-ip-info-not-available> if the saved ip file name is not specified.
In order to program to know where to look for saved IP files you need to
give some B<--file*> or B<--Config> option. The second string can also be
C<nochange> if current IP address is same as what was found from saved
file. Examples:

    100.197.1.6 last-ip-info-not-available
    100.197.1.6 100.197.1.7
    100.197.1.6 nochange 18
                         |
                         How many days since last saved IP

B<Note for tool developers:> additional information may be provided in
future. Don't rely on the count of the output words, but instead parse
output from left to right.

=item B<--Query-ipchanged ['exitcode']>

Print message if IP has changed or not. This option can take
an optional string argument C<exitcode> which causes program to
indicate changed ip address with standard shell status code
(in bash shell that would available at variable C<$?>):

    $ dyndns.pl --Query-ipchange exitcode --file-default \
      --Provider dyndns --Host xxx.dyndns.org
    $ echo $?

    ... the status code of shell ($?) would be:

    0   true value, changed
    1   false value, error code, i.e. not changed

Without the C<exitcode> argument, the returned strings are:

                Current IP address
                |
    changed  35 111.222.333.444

             Days since last IP update. Based on saved IP file's
             time stamp.

If the last saved IP file's time stamp is too old, then even if the IP were
not really changed, the situation is reported with word C<changed>. This is
due to time limits the DDNS providers have. The account would expire unless
it is updated in NN days.

B<Note for tool developers:> additional information may be provided in
future. Don't rely on the count of the output words, but instead parse
output from left to right.

=item B<--Query-ipfile>

Print the name of the IP file and quit.

B<Note:> In order for this option to work, you must supply all other
options would be normally pass to update the DDNS account, because the Ip
filename depends on these options. Alternatively provide option B<--Config
FILE> from where all relevant information if read.

    --ethernet      [optional, defaults to eth0]
    --Provider      [optional, defaults to dyndns]
    --system        [optional, defaults to dyndns]
    --Host          required.

Here is an example which supposed that directory C</var/log/dyndns/>
already exists:

    $ dyndns.pl --file-default --Query-ipfile \
      --Provider dyndns --Host xxx.dyndns.org
    /var/log/dyndns/eth0-dyndns-dyndns-xxx-dyndns.org.log

=item B<--regexp REGEXP>

In host, which has multiple netword cards, the response can include
multiple IP addresses. The default is to pick always the first choice, but
that may not be what is wanted. The regexp MUST not contain capturing
parentheses: if you need one, use non-capturing choice (?:). Refer to Perl
manual page C<perlre> for more information about non-cpaturing regular
expression parentheses.

Here is an example from Windows:

    Ethernet adapter {3C317757-AEE8-4DA7-9B68-C67B4D344103}:

        Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
        Autoconfiguration IP Address. . . : 169.254.241.150
        Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0
        Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :

    Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection 3:

        Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : somewhere.net
        IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 193.10.221.45
        Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0
        Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.0.101

The 193.10.221.45 is the intended dynamic IP address, not the first one.
To instruct searching from somewhere else in the listing, supply a
regular expressions that can match a portion in the listing after
which the IP address appears. In the above case, the regexp could be:

    --regexp "Connection 3:"

In Windows, the words that follow "IP Address" are automatically expected,
so you should not add them to the regexp.

In FreeBSD 4.5, you may get following response:

    tun0: flags <UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1492
        inet6 fe80::250:4ff:feef:7998%tun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x7
        inet 62.214.33.49 --> 255.255.255.255 netmask 0xffffffff
        inet 62.214.32.12 --> 255.255.255.255 netmask 0xffffffff
        inet 62.214.35.49 --> 255.255.255.255 netmask 0xffffffff
        inet 62.214.33.163 --> 62.214.32.1 netmask 0xff000000
        Opened by PID 64

The correct IP address to pick from the listing is the one, which does
not contain netmask 0xffffffff. The picked address for above is
therefore 62.214.33.163. The regexp that finds that line is:

    --regexp ".*0xffffffff.*?inet"
               |            |
               |            Search minimum match until word "inet"
               search maximum match

This will match all the way until the the last line with netmask
0xffffffff, after which shortest match C<.*?> to C<inet> is reached to read
the number following it. The regexp must make sure that the next word
after its match point is the wanted address.

If you do not have direct access to world known C<real> IP address, but to
a subnet IP address, then you cannot determine your outside world IP
address from your machine directly. See picture below:

                        router/subnet                    Internet
                       +-------------+                +-----------+
   Your PC:            |             | maps address   |           |
   connect to ISP -->  | ROUTER      | -------------> |           |
                       | 192.168.... |                | 80.1.1.1  |
   local ip says:      +-------------+                +-----------+
   192.168.xxx.xxx                                    THE REAL IP

ASDL and cable modem and other connections may not be directly connected to
Internet, but to a router to allow subnnetting internal hosts. This makes
several computers to access the Internet while the ISP has offered only one
visible IP address to you. The router makes the mapping of the local subnet
IP to the world known IP address, provided by the ISP when the connection
was established.

You need some way to find out what is the real IP is. The simplest way is
to connect to a some web page, which runs a reverse lookup service which
can show the connecting IP address.

Note: the following web web page does not exists. To find a service
that is able to display your IP address, do a google search. Let's
say, that you found a fictional service
C<http://www.example.com/showip> and somewhere in the web page it
reads:

        Your IP address is: 212.111.11.10

This is what you need. To automate the lookup from web page, you need
to instruct the program to connect to URL page and tell how to read
the ip from page by using a regular expression. Consult Perl's manual
page C<perlre> if you are unfamiliar with the regular expressions. For
the above fictional service, the options needed would be:

    --urlping         "http://showip.org/?showit.pl"
    --urlping-regexp  "address is:\s+([\d.]+)"
                                  |  ||
                                  |  |+- Read all digits and periods
                                  |  |
                                  |  +- capturing parentheses
                                  |
                                  +- expect any number of whitespaces

NOTE: The text to match from web page is not text/plain, but text/html,
so you must look at the HTML page's sources to match the IP
address correctly without the bold <b> tags etc.

=item B<--urlping URL>

Web page where world known IP address can be read. If you find a Web server
that is running some program, which can show your IP addres, use it. The
example below connects to site and calls CGI program to make show the
connector's IP address. Be polite. Making calls like this too often
may cause putting blocks to your site.

    http://www.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/check_ip.cgi

Be sure to use period of 60 minutes or more with B<--Daemon> option to
not increase the load in the "ping" site and cause admin's to shut
down the service.

=item B<--urlping-dyndns>

Contact to www.dyndns.org service to obtain IP address information. This
is shorthand to more general optiopn B<--urlping>.

=item B<--urlping-linksys [TYPE]>

B<Specialized router option for Linksys products>.

This option connects to Linksys Wireless LAN 4-point router, whose page is
by default at local network address -<http://192.168.1.1/Status.htm>. The
world known IP address (which is provided by ISP) is parsed from that
page. The product is typically connected to the cable or DSL modem. Refer
to routing picture presented previously.

If the default login and password has been changed, options
B<--urlping-login> and B<--urlping-password> must be supplied

For TYPE information, See <http://www.linksys.com/>. Products codes currently
supported include:

 - BEFW11S4, Wireless Access Point Router with 4-Port Switch.
   Page: http://192.168.1.1/Status.htm
 - WRT54GL, Wireless WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router.
   Page: http://192.168.1.1/Status_Router.asp

=item B<--urlping-login LOGIN>

If C<--urlping> web page requires authentication, supply user name for
a secured web page.

=item B<--urlping-password LOGIN>

If C<--urlping> web page requires authentication, supply password for
a secured web page.

=item B<--urlping-regexp REGEXP>

After connecting to page with B<--urlping URL>, the web page is examined for
REGEXP. The regexp must catch the IP to perl match $1. Use non-capturing
parenthesis to control the match as needed. For example this is incorrect:

    --urlping-regexp "(Address|addr:)\s+([0-9.]+)"
                      |                 |
                      $1                $2

The match MUST be in "$1", so you must use non-capturing perl paentheses
for the first one:

    --urlping-regexp "(?:Address|addr:) +([0-9.]+)"
                       |                 |
                       non-capturing     $1

If this option is not given, the default value is to find first word
that matches:

    ([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)

=head1 README

Perl client for updating a dynamic DNS IP information at supported
providers (see C<--Provider>). Visit the page of the provider and create an
account. Write down the login name, password and host name you registered.

Program has been designed to work under any version of Windows or
Linux, possibly Mac OS included. It may not work under other Unix
variants due to different commands and outputs to get network IP
assignment information. Please see BUGS section how to provide details
to add support to other operating systems.

The dynamic DNS service allows mapping a dynamic IP address to a static
hostname. This way the computer can be refereed by name instead of ever
changing IP address from ISP's pool. The DDNS providers have may have basic
services, like single account and single host name, which may still be free
of charge. Please check the current status form the pages of the providers.

Separate files are used for remembering the last IP address to prevent
updating the same IP address again. This is necessary in order to comply
guidelines of the providers where multiple updates of the same IP address
could cause your domain to be blocked. You should not normally need to
touch the files where the ip addresses are stored.

If you know what you are doing and desperately need a forced update,
delete the IP files and start program with apropriate arguments.
Without the information about previous IP address, program sends a new
update request to the provider.

For windows operating systems, you need to install Perl. There are two
Perl incarnatons: Native Windows version (Activestate Perl) and Cygwin
version. It is recommended that you install Cygwin suite, which
includes Perl from C<http://www.cygwin.com/>. The Cygwin is a Unix
layer running on top of windws and makes it possible to use cron jobs
etc. just like in Linux systems. If you have no prior experience on
Unix/Linux, then the Activestate Perl might be better for Windows.
Activestate includes a Windows installer, but the Perl programs must
be run through Perl interpreter. For Activestate, put programs along
PATH and use command line call with option B<-S> to instruct to search
PATH:

    perl -S dyndns.pl [options]

=head1 EXAMPLES

To check current IP address:

  dyndns.pl --Query [--urlping...]
                    |
                    Select correct option to do the "ping" for IP

Show where the ip file is/would be stored with given connect options.
The option B<--file-default> uses OS's default directory structure.

  dyndns.pl --file-default --Query-ipfile --Provider dyndns \
            --Host xxx.dyndns.org

To upate account information to DDNS provider:

  dyndns.pl --login <login> --password <pass> --Host your.dyndns.org

If you have a cable or DSL and your router can display a web page
containing the world known IP address, you can instruct to "ping"
it. Suppose that router occupies address 192.168.1.1 and page that
displays the world known IP is C<status.html>, and you have to log in
the router using username C<foo> and password C<bar>:

  dyndns.pl --urlping http://192.168.1.1/Status.html \
            --urlping-login foo                      \
            --urlping-pass  bar                      \

If the default regexp does not find IP address from the page, supply
your own match with option B<--urlping-regexp>. In case of doubt, add
option B<--debug 1> and examine the responses. In serious doubt, contact
the maintainer (see option B<--Version>) and send the full debug
output.

Tip: if you run a local web server, provider C<www.dyndns.org> can direct
calls to it. See option C<--Wildcard> to enable `*.your.dyndns.org' domain
delegation, like if it we accessed using `www.your.dyndns.org'.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

Instead of supplying options at command line, the options can be stored to
configuration files. For each DDNS account and different domains, a
separate configuration file must be created. The configuration files are
read with option B<--Config>.

The syntax of the configuration file includes comments that start with (#).
Anything after hash-sign is interpreted as comment. Values are set in KEY =
VALUE fashion, where spaces are non-significant. Keys are not case
sensitive, but values are.

Below, lines marked with [default] need only be set if the default value
needs to be changed. Lines marked with [noip] or [dyndns] apply to only
those providers' DDNS accounts. Notice that some keys, like C<host>, can
take multple values seprated by colons. On/Off options take values [1/0]
respectively. All host name values below are fictional.

    # /etc/dyndns/dyndns.conf

    #  Set to "yes" to make this configuration file excluded
    #  from updates.

    disable  = no       # [default]

    ethernet = eth0     # [default]
    group    = mygourp  # [noip]
    host     = host1.dyndns.org, host1.dyndns.org

    #   If you route mail. See dyndns.org documentation for details
    #   how to set up MX records. If you know nothing about DNS/BIND
    #   Don't even consider using this option. Misuse or broken
    #   DNS at your end will probably terminate your 'free' dyndns contract.

    mxhost   = mxhost.dyndns.org

    #   Details how to get the world known IP address, in case the standard
    #   Linux 'ifconfig' or Windows 'ipconfig' programs cannot be used. This
    #   interests mainly Cable, DSL and router owners. NOTE: You may
    #   not use all these options. E.g. [urlping-linksys4] is alternate
    #   to [urlping] etc. See documentation.

    urlping-linksys  = BEFW11S4
    urlping-login    = joe
    urlping-password = mypass

    urlping          = fictional.showip.org
    urlping-regexp   = (Address|addr:)\s+([0-9.]+)

    #   Where IPs are stored. Directory name or Directory name with
    #   additional file prefix. The directory part must exist. You could
    #   say 'file = /var/log/dyndns/' but that's the default.

    file     = default              # Use OS's default location

    #   The DDNS account details

    login    = mylogin
    password = mypass
    provider = dyndns               # [default]
    proxy    = myproxy.myisp.net    # set only if needed for HTTP calls

    #   Hou need this option only if you have multiple ethernet cards.
    #   After which regexp the IP number appers in ifconfig(1) listing?

    regexp   = .*0xffffffff.*?inet

    #   What account are you using? Select 'dyndns|statdns|custom'

    system   = dyndns               # Provider [dyndns] only

    #   Yes, delegate all *.mydomain.dyndns.org calls

    wildcard = 1

    # End of cnfiguration file

See the details of all of these options from the corresponding command line
option descriptions. E.g. option 'ethernet' in configuration file
corresponds to B<--ethernet> command line option. The normal configuration
file for average user would only include few lines:

    #   /etc/dyndns/myhost.dyndns.org.conf

    host             = myhost.dyndns.org
    file             = default      # Use OS's default location
    login            = mylogin
    password         = mypassword
    provider         = dyndns
    system           = dyndns       # or 'statdns'
    wildcard         = 1            # Delegate *.mydomain.dyndns.org

    # End of cnfiguration file

TODO (write Debian daemon scripts) FIXME:

    update-rc.d dyndns start 3 4 5 6    # Debian

=head1 SUPPORT REQUESTS

For new Operating System, provide all relevant commands, their options,
examples and their output which answer to following questions. The items in
parentheses are examples from Linux:

    - How is the OS detected? Send result of 'id -a', or if file/dir
      structure can be used to detect the system. In Lunux the
      existence of /boot/vmlinuz could indicate that "this is a Linux
      OS".
    - What is the command to get network information (commandlike 'ifconfig')
    - Where are the system configuration files stored (in directory /etc?)
    - Where are the log files stored (under /var/log?)

To add support for routers that can be connected through HTTP protocol
or with some other commands, please provide connection details and
full HTTP response:

  lynx -dump http://192.168.1.0/your-network/router/page.html

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

1. Turn on B<--debug> to see exact details how the program runs and
what HTTP requests are sent and received.

2. Most of the <--Query> options can't be used standalone. Please see
documentation what additional options you need to supply with them.

There is no default location where program would search for configuration
files. At installation, configuration examples are put in directory
C</etc/dyndns/examples>. It is recommended that the examples are modified
and copied one directorory up in order to use option B<--Config
/etc/dyndns/*>.

If program is run with Windows Activestate Perl, the log file is stored to

#       frequently than this - from the same IP address - will be
#       considered abusive by the update system and may result in your
#       hostname becoming blocked. Any script which runs periodically
#       should check to make sure that the IP has actually changed before
#       making an update, or the host will become blocked. An exception to
#       this is for users with mostly static IP addresses; you may update
#       24-30 days after your previous update with the same IP address to
#       "touch" the record and prevent it from expiring. Users will receive
#       an e-mail notification if a host has been unchanged for 28 days.
