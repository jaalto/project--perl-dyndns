.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A cross platform Perl client for updating dynamic \s-1DNS IP\s0 information
at supported providers (see \f(CW\*(C`\-\-provider\*(C'\fR). By Default this program
expects www.dyndns.org provider.
.PP
The dynamic \s-1DNS\s0 services allow mapping a dynamic \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss to a
static hostname. This way the host can be referred by name instead of
the changing \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss from the \s-1ISP\s0's pool. Some \s-1DDNS\s0 providers offer
a single account and a single host namefree of charge. Please check
the information from the Providers' pages.
.PP
Separate files are used for remembering the last \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss to prevent
updating the same \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss again. This is necessary in order to comply
guidelines of the providers where multiple updates of the same \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
could cause your domain to be blocked. You should not normally need to
touch the files where the \s-1IP\s0 addresssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssses are stored.
.PP
If you know what you are doing and desperately need a forced update,
delete the \s-1IP\s0 files and start program with apropriate arguments.
Without the information about previous \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss, program sends a new
update request to the provider.
.PP
Program has been designed to work under any version of Windows or
Linux, possibly Mac \s-1OS\s0 included. It may not work under other Unix/BSD
variants. Please see \s-1BUGS\s0 section how to provide details to add
support for other operating systems.
.PP
Visit the page of the provider and create an account. Write down the
login name, password and host name you registered.
.PP
For Windows operating systems, you need to install Perl. There are two
Perl incarnatons: Native Windows version (Activestate Perl) and Cygwin
version. The \f(CW\*(C`http://www.cygwin.com/\*(C'\fR is recommended as it more closely
follows the original Perl environment.

.SS "Gneneral options"
.IX Subsection "Gneneral options"
.IP "\fB\-\-config=FILE [\-\-config=FILE ...]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--config=FILE [--config=FILE ...]"
List of configuration files to read. No command line options other
than \fB\-\-verbose\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR or \fB\-\-test\fR should be appended or
results are undefined. Each file must contain complete \s-1DDNS\s0 account
configuration.
.Sp
The \s-1FILE\s0 part will go through Perl's \f(CW\*(C`glob()\*(C'\fR function, meaning that
the filenames are expanded. Series of configuration files can be run
at once e.g. within directory \f(CW\*(C`/etc/dyndns/\*(C'\fR by using a single
option. The order of the files processed is alphabetical:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    \-\-config=/etc/dyndns/*
.Ve
.Sp
See section \s-1CONFIGURATION FILE\s0 for more information how to write the files.
.IP "\fB\-\-host=host1 [\-\-host=host2 ...]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--host=host1 [--host=host2 ...]"
Use registered \s-1HOST\s0(s).
.IP "\fB\-\-group \s-1GROUP\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--group GROUP"
\&\fBThis option is only for \-\-provider noip\fR
.Sp
Assign \s-1IP\s0 to \s-1GROUP.\s0 Do you have many hosts that all update to the same
\&\s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss? Update a group instead of a many hosts.
.IP "\fB\-\-login \s-1LOGIN\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--login LOGIN"
\&\s-1DDNS\s0 account's \s-1LOGIN\s0 name.
.IP "\fB\-\-mxhost MX-HOST-NAME\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mxhost MX-HOST-NAME"
\&\fBThis option is only for \-\-provider dyndns\fR
.Sp
Update account information with \s-1MX\s0 hostname. Specifies a Mail eXchanger for
use with the host being modified. Must resolve to an \fBstatic\fR \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss,
or it will be ignored. If you don't know \s-1DNS,\s0 don't touch this option.
.Sp
The servers you list need to be correctly configured to accept mail for
your hostname, or this will do no good. Setting up a server as an \s-1MX\s0
without permission of the administrator may get them angry at you. If
someone is contacted about such an infraction, your \s-1MX\s0 record will be
removed and possibly further action taken to prevent it from happening
again. Any mail sent to a misconfigured server listed as an \s-1MX\s0 may bounce,
and may be lost.
.IP "\fB\-\-mx\-option\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mx-option"
\&\fBThis option is only for \-\-provider dyndns\fR
.Sp
Turn on \s-1MX\s0 option. Request that the \s-1MX\s0 in the previous parameter be set up
as a backup. This means that mail will first attempt to deliver to your
host directly, and will be delivered to the \s-1MX\s0 listed as a backup.
.Sp
Note regarding provider \f(CW\*(C`noip\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
Update clients cannot change this value. Clients can only submit requests
to the php script to update the A record. Changes such as \s-1MX\s0 records
must be done through website.
.IP "\fB\-\-offline\fR" 4
.IX Item "--offline"
If given, set the host to offline mode.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`Note:\*(C'\fR [dyndns] This feature is only available to donators. The
\&\*(L"!donator\*(R" return message will appear if this is set on a non-donator
host.
.Sp
This is useful if you will be going offline for an extended period of
time. If someone else gets your old \s-1IP\s0 your users will not go to your
old \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.
.IP "\fB\-\-password \s-1PASSWORD\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--password PASSWORD"
\&\s-1DDNS\s0 account's \s-1PASSWORD.\s0
.IP "\fB\-\-system {dyndns|statdns|custom}\fR" 4
.IX Item "--system {dyndns|statdns|custom}"
\&\fBThis option is only for \-\-provider dyndns\fR
.Sp
The system you wish to use for this update. \f(CW\*(C`dyndns\*(C'\fR will update a dynamic
host, \f(CW\*(C`custom\*(C'\fR will update a MyDynDNS Custom \s-1DNS\s0 host and \f(CW\*(C`statdns\*(C'\fR will
update a static host. The default value is \f(CW\*(C`dyndns\*(C'\fR and you cannot use
other options (statdns|custom) unless you donate and gain access to the
more advanced features.
.Sp
See the \s-1DDNS\s0 provider's pages for more information.
.IP "\fB\-\-wildcard\fR" 4
.IX Item "--wildcard"
Turn on wildcard option. The wildcard aliases \f(CW\*(C`*.yourhost.ourdomain.ext\*(C'\fR
to the same addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss as \f(CW\*(C`yourhost.ourdomain.ext\*(C'\fR
.SS "Additional options"
.IX Subsection "Additional options"
.IP "\fB\-D, \-\-daemon [\s-1WAIT\-MINUTES\s0]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D, --daemon [WAIT-MINUTES]"
Enter daemon mode. The term \*(L"daemon\*(R" refers to a standalone processes
which keep serving until killed. In daemon mode program enters into
infinite loop where \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss changes are checked periodically. For
each new ip addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss check, program waits for WAIT-MINUTES. Messages in
this mode are reported using \fIsyslog\fR\|(3); if available.
.Sp
This option is designed to be used in systems that do not provide Unix-like
cron capabilities (e.g under Windows \s-1OS\s0). It is better to use \fIcron\fR\|(8) and
define an entry using \fIcrontab\fR\|(5) notation to run the update in periodic
intervals. This will use less memory when Perl is not permanently kept in
memory like it would with option \fB\-\-daemon\fR.
.Sp
The update to \s-1DDNS\s0 provider happens only if
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    1) IP addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss changes
\&    2) or it has taken 30 days since last update.
\&       (See DDNS providers\*(Aq account expiration time documentation)
.Ve
.Sp
The minimum sleep time is 5 minutes. Program will not allow faster
wake up times(*). The value can be expressed in formats:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    15      Plain number, minutes
\&    15m     (m)inutes. Same sa above
\&    1h      (h)ours
\&    1d      (d)days
.Ve
.Sp
This options is primarily for permanent Internet connection. If you
have a dial-up connection, it is better to arrange the \s-1IP\s0 update at
the same time as when the connection is started. In Linux this would
happen during \f(CWifup(1)\fR.
.Sp
(*) Perl language is \s-1CPU\s0 intensive so any faster check would put
considerable strain on system resources. Normally a value of 30 or 60
minutes will work fine in most cases. Monitor the \s-1ISP\s0's \s-1IP\s0 rotation
time to adjust the time in to use sufficiently long wake up times.
.IP "\fB\-\-ethernet [\s-1CARD\s0]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ethernet [CARD]"
In Linux system, the automatic \s-1IP\s0 detection uses program
\&\f(CWifconfig(1)\fR. If you have multiple network cards, select the correct
card with this option. The default device used for query is \f(CW\*(C`eth0\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-file \s-1PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--file PREFIX"
Prefix where to save \s-1IP\s0 information. This can be a) a absolute path name to
a file b) directory where to save or c) directory + prefix where to save.
Make sure that files in this location do not get deleted. If they are
deleted and you happen to update \s-1SAME\s0 ip twice within a short period \-
according to www.dyndns.org \s-1FAQ \-\s0 your addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss may be blocked.
.Sp
On Windows platform all filenames must use forward slashes like
\&\f(CW\*(C`C:/somedir/to/\*(C'\fR, not \f(CW\*(C`C:\esomedir\eto\e\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \s-1PREFIX\s0 is only used as a basename for supported \s-1DDNS\s0 accounts (see
\&\fB\-\-provider\fR). The saved filename is constructed like this:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   PREFIX<ethernet\-card>\-<update\-system>\-<host>\-<provider>.log
\&                          |
\&                          See option \-\-system
.Ve
.Sp
A sample filename in Linux could be something like this if \s-1PREFIX\s0 were set
to \f(CW\*(C`/var/log/dyndns/\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    /var/log/dyndns/eth0\-statdns\-my.dyndns.org\-dyndns.log
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-f, \-\-file\-default\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f, --file-default"
Use reasonable default for saved \s-1IP\s0 file \s-1PREFIX \s0(see \fB\-\-file\fR). Under
Windows, \f(CW%WINDIR\fR% is used. Under Linux the PREFIXes searched are
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    /var/log/dyndns/     (if directory exists)
\&    /var/log/            (system\*(Aqs standard)
\&    $HOME/tmp or $HOME   If process is not running under root
.Ve
.Sp
This options is by default activated if \fB\-\-file\fR is not in use.
.IP "\fB\-\-proxy \s-1HOST\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--proxy HOST"
Use \s-1HOST\s0 as outgoing \s-1HTTP\s0 proxy.
.IP "\fB\-P, \-\-provider \s-1TYPE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P, --provider TYPE"
By default, program connects to \f(CW\*(C`dyndns.org\*(C'\fR to update the dynamic \s-1IP\s0
addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss. There are many free dynamic \s-1DNS\s0 providers are reported.

.IP "\fB\-\-query\-ipchanged ['exitcode']\fR" 4
.IX Item "--query-ipchanged ['exitcode']"
Print message if \s-1IP\s0 has changed or not. This option can take
an optional string argument \f(CW\*(C`exitcode\*(C'\fR which causes program to
indicate changed ip addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss with standard shell status code

If the last saved \s-1IP\s0 file's time stamp is too old, then even if the \s-1IP\s0 were
not really changed, the situation is reported with word \f(CW\*(C`changed\*(C'\fR. This is
due to time limits the \s-1DDNS\s0 providers have. The account would expire unless

that may not be what is wanted. The regexp \s-1MUST\s0 not contain capturing
parentheses: if you need one, use non-capturing choice (?:). Refer to Perl
manual page \f(CW\*(C`perlre\*(C'\fR for more information about non-cpaturing regular

Here is an example from Windows:
.Sp
.Vb 1

\&
\&        Connection\-specific DNS Suffix  . :

\&        Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.10.0.101
.Ve
.Sp
The 193.10.221.45 is the intended dynamic \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss, not the first one.
To instruct searching from somewhere else in the listing, supply a
regular expressions that can match a portion in the listing after
which the \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss appears. In the above case, the regexp could be:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    \-\-regexp "Connection 3:"
.Ve
.Sp
In Windows, the words that follow \*(L"\s-1IP\s0 Address\*(R" are automatically expected,
so you should not add them to the regexp.
.Sp
In FreeBSD 4.5, you may get following response:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    tun0: flags <UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1492
\&        inet6 fe80::250:4ff:feef:7998%tun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x7

\&        inet 62.214.35.49 \-\-> 255.255.255.255 netmask 0xffffffff

\&        Opened by PID 64
.Ve
.Sp
The correct \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss to pick from the listing is the one, which does
not contain netmask 0xffffffff. The picked addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss for above is
therefore 62.214.33.163. The regexp that finds that line is:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    \-\-regexp ".*0xffffffff.*?inet"
\&               |            |
\&               |            Search minimum match until word "inet"
\&               search maximum match
.Ve
.Sp
This will match all the way until the the last line with netmask
0xffffffff, after which shortest match \f(CW\*(C`.*?\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`inet\*(C'\fR is reached to read
the number following it. The regexp must make sure that the next word
after its match point is the wanted addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.

\&\s-1ASDL\s0 and cable modem and other connections may not be directly connected to

several computers to access the Internet while the \s-1ISP\s0 has offered only one

Note: the following web web page does not exists. To find a service
that is able to display your \s-1IP\s0 addressssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss, do a google search. Let's

reads:

to instruct the program to connect to \s-1URL\s0 page and tell how to read
the ip from page by using a regular expression. Consult Perl's manual
page \f(CW\*(C`perlre\*(C'\fR if you are unfamiliar with the regular expressions. For

There is no syslog daemon in Cygwin. The Cygwin \s-1POSIX\s0 emulation layer takes
care about syslog requests. On \s-1NT\s0 and above systems it logs to the
Windows's event manager, on Win9x and \s-1ME\s0 a file is created in the root of
drive \f(CW\*(C`C:\*(C'\fR. See message <http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2002\-10/msg00219.html>
for more details.
